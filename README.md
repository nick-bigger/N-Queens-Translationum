# N-Queens Translationum

This is my solution to the N-Queens problem in five different languages (and possibly more as I continue to add to this project). It is an exercise I decided to do as I learned Go and Rust, but is also an interesting look at how to accomplish the same problem in different languages.

NOTE: None of these are perfect, I am aware that [there are more efficient ways to solve the N-Queens problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/discuss/19810/Fast-short-and-easy-to-understand-python-solution-11-lines-76ms). I'm also not an expert at any of these languages (especially Go and Rust)!
